        <h1>Celery & Dried Tofu Stir-Fry</h1>

        <img src="../recipes/celerytofu.jpg" alt="Celery and Dried Tofu Stir-Fry">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This simple Chinese stir-fry dish is so quick and easy to cook, making it a very convenient meal. 
            It only requires two very basic ingredients: tomatos and eggs. The rest are optional but very important 
            to spice up this dish and contribute to such a savory taste. This dish is usually combined with white rice.

                    In the pan, heat 1 tablespoon oil over high heat. Stir-fry the spiced tofu for 
                    a couple minutes until browned slightly. Set aside.

                    Heat another tablespoon of oil and stir fry the peppers for about a minute.
